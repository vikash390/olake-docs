|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **type**                 | Specifies the output file format for writing data. Currently, only the `"PARQUET"` format is supported.                                                                                                                                             | string        | `"PARQUET"`                                                             |
| **writer.s3_bucket**     | The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where your output files will be stored. Ensure that the bucket exists and that you have proper access.                                                                                                             | string        | A valid S3 bucket name (e.g. `"olake-s3-test"`)                          |
| **writer.s3_region**     | The AWS region where the specified S3 bucket is hosted.                                                                                                                                                                                             | string        | AWS region codes such as `"ap-south-1"`, `"us-west-2"`, etc.              |
| **writer.s3_access_key** | The AWS access key used for authenticating S3 requests. This is typically a 20-character alphanumeric string.                                                                                                                                       | string        | A valid AWS access key                                                  |
| **writer.s3_secret_key** | The AWS secret key used for S3 authentication. This key is generally longer (often 40+ characters) and should be kept secure.                                                                                                                         | string        | A valid AWS secret key                                                  |
| **writer.s3_path**       | The specific path (or prefix) within the S3 bucket where data files will be written. This is typically a folder path that starts with a `/` (e.g. `"/data"`).                                                                                    | string        | A valid path string                                                     |

:::info
1. The generated `.parquet` files use SNAPPY compression ([Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(compression))). Note that SNAPPY is no longer supported by S3 Select when performing queries.  
2. OLake creates a test folder named `olake_writer_test` containing a single text file (`.txt`) with the content:
   ```text
   S3 write test
   ```
   This is used to verify that you have the necessary permissions to write to S3.
