# OLake Features Overview

OLake is an open-source, high-performance data pipeline designed to extract data from Databses (like MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres) and load it into modern data lakehouse formats like Apache Iceberg and Parquet. 

Its modular architecture is built around fast, parallelized data ingestion, real-time change data capture (CDC), and native support for schema evolution and S3 data partitioning. 

OLake minimizes vendor lock-in while offering extensive configurability—from full snapshot loads to incremental syncs and stateful resumption—making it an ideal solution for modern data engineering challenges.


### TLDR;
- [**Iceberg Writer**](/docs/writers/iceberg/overview): OLake writes data in Apache Iceberg format, which is an open table format for huge analytic datasets.
- **Open Formats**: OLake stores data in open formats like Parquet and Apache Iceberg, ensuring that your data is accessible and queryable by a variety of tools.
- [**AWS S3 Partitioning**](/docs/writers/s3/overview): OLake supports partitioning data in S3, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
- [**Iceberg Partitioning**](/docs/writers/iceberg/partitioning): OLake supports partitioning data in Apache Iceberg, allowing for efficient querying.
- **Apache Iceberg Catalog Support**: OLake supports various catalog types, including [REST](/docs/writers/iceberg/catalog/rest), [Hive](/docs/writers/iceberg/catalog/hive), [AWS Glue](/docs/writers/iceberg/catalog/glue), and [JDBC](/docs/writers/iceberg/catalog/jdbc), allowing for easy integration with your existing data lake infrastructure.
- **Parallelized Chunking**: OLake divides the data into smaller chunks for faster processing and parallel execution.
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: OLake captures changes in the source database in near real-time, ensuring that your data lake is always up-to-date.
- **Schema Evolution**: OLake automatically adapts to schema changes in the source database, maintaining consistency and integrity in your data lake.
- **Schema Datatype Changes**: OLake provides native support for schema evolution, including data type changes, aligned with the capabilities defined by Apache Iceberg v2 table specifications.
- [**Source Database Connectors**](/docs/connectors/overview): OLake provides connectors for various databases, including MongoDB, Postgres, and MySQL, allowing for easy integration with your existing data sources.
- **Data Flattening / Normalization**: OLake supports Level 1 flattening of Data for JSON type fields, allowing for easier querying and analysis of complex data structures.
- **Synchronization Modes**: OLake supports both full and CDC (Change Data Capture) synchronization modes. Incremental sync is a work in progress and will be released soon.
- **Sync with state**: OLake supports syncing with state, meaning, it can keep track of the last synced state and only sync new or updated data.
- **Resumable Full Load**: OLake supports resumable full load, meaning, if a full load fails, it can be resumed from the last successful checkpoint.
- **Backoff Retry Count**: OLake supports backoff retry count, meaning, if a sync fails, it will retry the sync after a certain period of time.


## 1. Connector Features

OLake’s connector includes several  features that ensure efficient and reliable data replication:

### Native BSON Extraction [for mongodb]
- **What it does:** Extracts data in its raw `BSON` form directly from MongoDB.
- **Benefit:** Maintains data fidelity while boosting speed by decoding on the ETL side.

### Parallel Chunking
- **What it does:** Splits large collections into smaller virtual chunks.
- **Benefit:** Enables parallel reads, significantly reducing the time required for full collection snapshots.

### CDC Cursor Preservation
- **What it does:** Keeps track of CDC (Change Data Capture) offsets throughout the data ingestion process.
- **Benefit:** Supports the addition of new large collections without interrupting ongoing incremental syncs.

### Open Format for Freedom
- **What it does:** Uses open formats like Parquet and table formats like Apache Iceberg.
- **Benefit:** Sidesteps vendor lock-in and allows multi-engine querying.

### Resumable Full Load & Incremental Sync
- Both full snapshots and incremental (CDC) syncs are designed to be resumable. If a sync is interrupted, OLake uses state files to resume progress seamlessly.

### S3 Data Partition
- **What it does:** Supports partitioning data when writing to S3.
- **Benefit:** Improves query performance by organizing data into directories based on user-defined partitioning logic.

### Schema Evolution
- **What it does:** Detects changes in source document structures and handles non-breaking changes.
- **Benefit:** Minimizes disruptions when the underlying schema evolves; separate Parquet files are created if schema evolution is detected (currently in S3).

### Normalization vs. Denormalization
- **What it does:** Offers an option to choose between normalization and level-1 denormalization (flattening).
- **Benefit:** Gives flexibility in data transformation depending on downstream requirements.

### Supported Data Types
OLake supports a variety of data types. The table below summarizes the supported types along with descriptions and sample values:

### Synchronization Modes
The streams file defines how streams are synchronized:
- **`supported_sync_modes`:** Lists the supported modes (e.g., `full_refresh`, `cdc`).
- **`sync_mode`:** Indicates the active sync mode for a stream.

### Backoff Retry Count
- **What it does:** Implements an exponential backoff (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 minutes…) for retrying sync operations.
- **Default:** Set to 3 (or takes the default value if set to -1).

### Sync with State of Last Synced Cursor
- **What it does:** Saves progress in a state file (e.g., `state.json`) so that an interrupted sync can resume from the last known checkpoint.


## 2. Data Flow in OLake

OLake’s data flow is designed for high throughput and resiliency:

### Initial Snapshot
- **Process:** Executes a full collection read by firing queries.
- **Parallelism:** Divides the collection into chunks that are processed in parallel.
- **Insight:** Provides an estimated remaining time along with real-time stats (e.g., memory usage, running threads, records per second) in `stats.json` file created automatically at the place when your configs (`source.json` and `destination.json` are being added).

```json
{
    "Estimated Remaining Time": "340.85 s",
    "Memory": "92329 mb",
    "Running Threads": 10,
    "Seconds Elapsed": "148.00",
    "Speed": "5773.03 rps",
    "Synced Records": 854411
}
```

### Change Data Capture (CDC)
- **Process:** Sets up MongoDB change streams based on oplogs to capture near real-time updates.
- **Resilience:** Ensures that any changes during the snapshot are also captured, and subsequent updates are continuously synced.

### Parallel Processing
- **Configuration:** Users can set the number of parallel threads to balance speed with the load on the MongoDB cluster.

### Transformation & Normalization
- **What it does:** Flattens complex, semi-structured fields into relational streams.
- **Current Support:** Level-0 flattening is available, with more advanced nested JSON support coming soon.

### Integrated Writes
- **What it does:** Pushes transformed data directly to target destinations (e.g., local Parquet files, S3 Iceberg Parquet) without intermediary buffering.
- **Benefit:** Minimizes latency and avoids blocking reads during writes.

### Logs & Testing
- **Logging:** Detailed logs using Zerolog and Lumberjack help monitor the process, we create a logs.txt file that saves all your logs during the sync process.

## 3. Architecture and Components

OLake is built with a modular design to separate responsibilities across different components:

### Drivers (Connectors)
- **Function:** Embed the logic necessary to interact with the source system (starting with MongoDB, with plans for Kafka, Postgres, MySQL, and DynamoDB).
- **Responsibilities:** 
  - **Full Load:** Efficiently fetch complete collections by processing them in parallel.
  - **CDC Management:** Configure change streams to capture and sync incremental changes.

### Destinations
- **Function:** Tightly integrated with drivers to directly push records to destinations.
- **Supported Destinations:** 
  - Local Parquet files
  - AWS S3 
  - Apache Iceberg 

### Core Functionality
- **CLI & Commands:** 
  - `spec` returns a JSON Schema for frontend configuration.
  - `check` validates configuration, streams, state files, and credentials.
  - `discover` lists streams and their schemas.
  - `sync` orchestrates the ETL process.
- **State Management:** Ensures that CDC streams can resume after interruptions.
- **Configuration & Logging:** Manages concurrency levels, connection credentials, and provides real-time monitoring of progress and throughput.


## 4. S3 Data Partitioning

OLake provides robust support for S3 data partitioning, enabling efficient data organization and faster query performance.

### Overview
- **How It Works:** After schema discovery, you can define a `partition_regex` in the `streams.json` file for each stream. This regex dynamically partitions data into folders in your S3 bucket.
- **Resulting Structure:** The generated S3 path typically includes the database name, table/collection name, and partition values (e.g., date components or key-value pairs).

### Sample Configuration
```json
{
  "selected_streams": {
    "namespace": [
      {
        "stream_name": "table1",
        "partition_regex": "/{column_name, default_value, granularity}"
      },
      {
        "stream_name": "table2",
        "partition_regex": ""
      }
    ]
  },
  "streams": [
    {
      "stream": {
        "name": "table1",
        "namespace": "namespace",
        "sync_mode": "cdc"
      }
    },
    {
      "stream": {
        "name": "table2",
        "namespace": "namespace",
        "sync_mode": "cdc"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Partition Regex Attributes
- **Structure:**  
  `"partition_regex": "/{column_name, default_value, granularity}"`
- **Components:**
  - **column_name:** (Required) Specifies which column’s value determines the partition.
  - **default_value:** (Optional) A fallback if the column is null or unparseable.
  - **granularity:** (Optional) For time-based columns, define granularity (e.g., HH, DD, MM, YY).

### Supported Patterns
- **now():** Uses the current local timestamp.
- **default:** Uses a constant fallback value.
- **`{col_name}`:** Inserts the specified column value.
- **Combined patterns:**  
  - `{now(),2025,YY}` yields the year (e.g., `2025`).
  - `{now(),2025,YY}-{now(),06,MM}-{now(),13,DD}` combines year, month, and day.

### Examples
- **Date-based Partition:**  
  ```json
  "partition_regex": "/{title,,}/{now(),2025,DD}/{latest_version,,}"
  ```
- **Key-Value Style Partitioning:**  
  ```json
  "partition_regex": "/age={age_column, default_age,}/city={city_column, default_city,}/type={type_column, default_type,}"
  ```
  For a record:
  ```json
  { "age": "30", "city": "mumbai", "type": "existing" }
  ```
  The resulting S3 path would be:  
  `s3://your_bucket/age=30/location=city-mumbai/type=existing/<filename>.parquet`

- **Composite Partitions Including Date:**  
  ```json
  "partition_regex": "/dt={now(),2025,YY}-{now(),06,MM}-{now(),13,DD}/country={country,default_country,}/city={city,default_city,}"
  ```
  This produces a path such as:  
  `s3://your_bucket/dt=2025-02-18/country=USA/city=NewYork/<filename>.parquet`

### Supported Timestamp Formats
OLake supports a wide range of timestamp formats, including:
- `"2006-01-02"`
- `"2006-01-02 15:04:05"`
- `"2006-01-02T15:04:05"`
- `"2020-08-17T05:50:22.895Z"`
- _and several others_

For custom timestamp columns, replace `now()` with the column name and specify the desired format extraction.



### Test Image Releaser
- **What it does:** Adds support for building test images via a “test_mode” option in the GitHub workflow.
- **Benefits and changes:**
  - **Test Mode Active:** Tags are prefixed with `testing-` (e.g., `testing-dev-123`).
  - **Validation:** Bypasses semantic version validation for test images, while production images must follow strict versioning.
  - **Output Examples:**  
    ```
    Test mode: true
    ✅ Test mode active - skipping semantic version validation for version: dev-123
    **** Releasing olakego/source-mongodb for platforms [linux/amd64,linux/arm64] with version [testing-dev-123] ****
    Release successful for olakego/source-mongodb version testing-dev-123
    ```
