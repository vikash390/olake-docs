# S3 Configuration

:::info
1. The generated `.parquet` files use SNAPPY compression ([Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(compression))). Note that SNAPPY is no longer supported by S3 Select when performing queries.  
2. OLake creates a test folder named `olake_writer_test` containing a single text file (`.txt`) with the content:
   ```text
   S3 write test
   ```
   This is used to verify that you have the necessary permissions to write to S3.
