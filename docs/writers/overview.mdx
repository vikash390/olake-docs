# Supported Destinations

OLake replicates data to multiple destinations to cater to a variety of deployment scenarios. 

Whether you're storing data locally for quick access or using cloud storage services like S3 for scalability, our system is designed to integrate seamlessly. 

We are also working on adding support for Iceberg to facilitate advanced analytics and data lake management.

##  Data Partitioning

While not directly configured in `destination.json`, data partitioning is an important aspect of how your data is organized when written to storage. For more details on partitioning strategies (especially when using S3), please refer to the [S3 partitioning documentation](./s3/partitioning).


If you have any further questions or need additional support, please refer to the [getting started](../getting-started/overview) section or the [OLake README](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/blob/master/README.md).
