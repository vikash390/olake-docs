# Supported Destinations

OLake replicates data to multiple destinations to cater to a variety of deployment scenarios. 

Whether you're storing data locally for quick access or using cloud storage services like S3 for scalability, our system is designed to integrate seamlessly. 

We are also working on adding support for Iceberg to facilitate advanced analytics and data lake management.

<SupportedDestinations/>

Visit [OLake roadmap](../roadmap) for more information.

Before proceeding with either configuration, please ensure you have completed the [getting started](../getting-started/overview) instructions. For more background details, refer to the [README section](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/blob/master/README.md).

##  Data Partitioning

While not directly configured in `destination.json`, data partitioning is an important aspect of how your data is organized when written to storage. For more details on partitioning strategies, please refer to: 

- The [AWS S3 partitioning documentation](./parquet/partitioning).
- The [Apache Iceberg data partitioning documentation](./iceberg/partitioning).


## Schema Evolution and Data Type Mapping
Schema evolution is a critical feature that allows you to modify the structure of your data over time. OLake supports schema evolution, enabling you to add, remove, or change fields in your data schema without losing existing data.
For more information on schema evolution and data type mapping, please refer to the following sections:
- [Schema Evolution](../features/schema)


If you have any further questions or need additional support, please refer to the [getting started](../getting-started/overview) section or the [OLake README](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/blob/master/README.md).
