# Postgres Overview


## To sync data TLDR:
1. **Create a [`source.json`](./config)** with your Postgres connection details.
2. **Create a `destination.json`** with your Writer ([Apache Iceberg](../../writers/iceberg/catalog/overview) or [AWS S3](../../writers/s3/config)) connection details.
3. **Run `discover`** to generate a `streams.json` of available streams.
4. **Run `sync`** to replicate data to your specified destination.


## Features

- Resumable Full Load: Supports restarting full loads without reprocessing all data.
- Fast Full Load via Chunking:
  • CTID-based chunking
  • Single split-column chunking
  • Evenly distributed chunks (for int/float PKs)
  • Uneven chunking support
- WAL2JSON-based CDC Sync for incremental updates. 

:::caution
Currently plugin of `pgoutput` as replication slot is not supported, only `WAL2JSON` is supported.
:::

- New streams are automatically synced when added.
- LSN mismatch handling triggers a full resync.

## Postgres Driver

The Postgres Driver enables data synchronization from Postgres to your desired destination. 

{/* <DocCardList/> */}
Below is an overview of the supported modes and writers for Postgres data replication, along with tables summarizing the details.

### Supported Modes

Our replication process supports various modes to fit different data ingestion needs. 

The **Full Refresh** mode retrieves the entire dataset from Postgres and is ideal for initial data loads or when a complete dataset copy is required. 

In contrast, **CDC (Change Data Capture)** continuously tracks and synchronizes incremental changes in real time, making sure that your destination remains updated with minimal latency. 

The **Incremental** mode is currently under development (WIP).

| Mode                          | Description                                                             |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Full Refresh**              | Fetches the complete dataset from Postgres.                            |
| **CDC (Change Data Capture)** | Tracks and syncs incremental changes from Postgres in real time.         |
| Incremental                   | No, WIP                                                                 |

### Supported Destinations

OLake replicates data to multiple destinations to cater to a variety of deployment scenarios. 

Whether you're storing data locally for quick access or using cloud storage services like S3 for scalability, our system is designed to integrate seamlessly. 

We are also working on adding support for Iceberg to facilitate advanced analytics and data lake management.

## Setup and Configuration

To run the Postgres Driver, configure the following files with your specific credentials and settings:

- **`source.json`**: Postgres connection details.  
- **`streams.json`**: List of collections and fields to sync (generated using the *Discover* command).  
- **`write.json`**: Configuration for the destination where the data will be written.

Place these files in your project directory before running the commands.

## Config File 
Add Postgres credentials in following format in `source.json` file as shown [here.](./config#sourcejson-configuration)

### Commands

### Discover Command

The *Discover* command generates json content for `streams.json` file, which defines the schema of the collections to be synced.

#### Usage
To run the Discover command, use the following syntax

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="docker-postgres" label="OLake Docker" default>
<DockerDiscoverPostgres/>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker-local" label="Locally run OLake" default>
<LocalDiscoverPostgres/>
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Catalog File 
After executing the Discover command, a `streams.json` file is created. Read more about [Catalog File](./config#streamsjson-configuration) here.


## Writer File 

Read about about 
1. [Apache Iceberg Destination config](../../writers/iceberg/catalog/overview)
2. S3 writer [here](../../writers/s3/overview)
3. [local writer](../../writers/local) 

### Sync Command

The *Sync* command fetches data from Postgres and ingests it into the destination.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="docker-postgres" label="OLake Docker" default>
<DockerSyncPostgres/>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker-local" label="Locally run OLake" default>
<LocalSyncPostgres/>
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

To run sync with state:


<Tabs>

<TabItem value="docker-postgres" label="OLake Docker" default>
<DockerSyncWithStatePostgres/>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker-local" label="Locally run OLake" default>
<LocalSyncWithStatePostgres/>
</TabItem>

</Tabs>
